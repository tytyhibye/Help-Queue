// expect(ticketListReducer({}, {type: null})).toEqual({});
//expect from Jest and plain JS
//ticketListReducer - reducer handles the update to state
//Reducer takes two arguments - current state and ACTION (it's an object with not much in it right now)
//toEqual method - Jest test

//action type is null - we do nothing to it
